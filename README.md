## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built With <a name = "tech_stack"></a>

## üì¢ Application Contents:
 


* This project is a Realtime Chat application leveraging the power of Pusher. It provides a seamless chat experience with features like realtime messaging, pagination, photo sharing, wave records, and delightful animations.

* The development tools used in this project include dio, retrofit, retrofit_generator, build_runner, freezed, freezed_annotation, and json_serializable. These tools enable efficient API integration and data serialization.

* The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, adheres to SOLID principles, and implements Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts. This ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase.

* The UI is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations. It includes maps integration for location-based features and supports notifications for real-time updates.

* One-Tap payment integration is implemented for seamless payment transactions within the app. The app also provides various ways to browse and filter consultants, including vertical and grid view, search by name, country, city, categories, sub-categories, years of experience, account verification status, ratings, and more.

* Additionally, the app includes an advertisements page, similar to social media platforms, with features like video advertisements, creating, editing, and deleting personal advertisements. Users can also send inquiries and view consultant details through the consultant's advertisements section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>This project encompasses a robust set of features and technologies to deliver a comprehensive and engaging experience for users.
